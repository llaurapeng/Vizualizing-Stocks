# Vizualizing-Stocks

App Link: https://vizualizing-stocks.streamlit.app/

I created a app to vizualize stocks. The first tab allows you to compare and contrast how different companies' stocks are doing. There is a slider at the button that allows you to adjust what time period you want to see. The second tab shows how individual company's stocks are. There is a candle plot of the closing values, bar plot that shows the volume traded, and the relative strength index. On the side, there are some other key metrics. There is also a slider that allows you to choose what time period you would like to see and you can also zoom in the graph to see points more closely.
